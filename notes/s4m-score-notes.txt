Notes for the score paper

Read macros article:
https://lisper.in/reader-macros
- apparently also in the book

To Test:
- meter changes 
- fractional beats
- offsets of bars or beats
- 3/4 12/8 7/8, etc

Issues:
- changing meters
- timesigs in live??
- timing goes out the window if the resolution is too low,
  which I didn't think was supposed to happen? 
  should we not just get underruns?
  I guess that shows that the scheduler IS getting preempted???
  - or is it an error? works ok down to res 2 and then craps out at 1, weird...
- if we change meter, what happens or times that are out of range??

For paper:
- note about metro not starting in right place when active
- do a long record to check for timing, and compare against looping too
  - at a quick glance it seems good

TODO:
- figure out lowest resolution workable - seems to be 2, 4 is definitely ok

Questions:


Thoughts:
- commas ARE special in max, so having a replacement for comma does make sense
- remember: delay-tq calculates the correct time according to the tempo of the transport,
  but doesn't need the transport to be running
  - the quantize does have an effect if the transport is running
  - but tempo changes after scheduling do NOT
- which means that the way we are running right now does make sense for ensuring
  tempo glides can work - scheduling everything by the bar would be a problem
- I think it's fine to say in paper that one must experiment with the lowest resolution to work
  - can provide my sync test patch

- would be nice to be able to replace an entire bar

- big thing to look into to make it more compelling would be adding delays that can go 
  to different named transports

- need to make sure it can happily run for a long time too!
  - maybe reuse a clock??
