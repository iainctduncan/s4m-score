Notes for the score paper

Read macros article:
https://lisper.in/reader-macros
- apparently also in the book

To Test:
- multiple entries with same time
- tempo changes
- key sig changes
- fractional beats
- offsets of bars or beats

Issues:
- changing meters
- evaling immediately vs later
- tick match off by a beat
- subsequent calls to an already used time are not working

- timesigs in live??
- TODO: simple note event

Questions:
- does plugsync work in Max? 
- changing tempo and time sig in score

Ideas
- allow variables for times?
- allow it to hop around?


Thoughts:
- commas ARE special in max, so having a replacement for comma does make sense
