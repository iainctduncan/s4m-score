TODO on the score

- lists of events aren't sensible
- it stores procedures instead of quoted lists to eval

- get rid of play-events if its reduntant

- for now let's say first item in a nested call can't be a list
  so we will use lists of lists:
    :1-1  (n 60 90 120)
    :1-2  ((n 60 90 120) (n 64 90 120))
    :1-3  (n 60 90 ,(random 120)


  - stopping
  - time sig changes
